# Symfony-4-Bootstrap-4-Responsive-AdminPanel
Symfony 4 and Bootstrap 4 Responsive with Admin CRUD Categories

# PART 1: JQUERY / BOOTSTRAP 4 FRONTEND
You will need to create an image browser using Bootstrap 4. Use the wireframes located in the WIREFRAMES
section for instructions on how the interactions work from screen to screen.
The categories for the gallery needs to be dynamic. To meet this requirement, you will need to create a Category
management system which the frontend will be sending requests to get required data via an AJAX call.
You will be using images from Flickr using the Flickr API to get the work you need to accomplish done. The Flickr API
is well documented and you will have all the help you need within the documentation.
Your solution should work best with portrait mode phones, but at the same time, not look broken when viewing it in
landscape.

# TARGET DEVICES
Your target devices and browsers are:
● IPhone X (with latest version browser).
● Google Pixel 3 (with latest version browser).
● Latest versions of Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox

# PART 2: SYMFONY 4 BACKEND / API

Create a password protected Category Management System:

● Users need to login with the following credentials:
○ Username: adminuser@example.com
○ Password: Somepassword1234!
● Users can add a category.
● Users can update a category.
● Users can delete a category.
● Users can view a list of existing categories.
● The categories need to be displayed as navigation for the gallery.

The backend interface will be left up to you, but it has to look good and allow for easy management of categories.
